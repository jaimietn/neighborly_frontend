              There are always times when an old-fashioned neighborhood bulletin board would come in handy… Whether you see a stray dog in your neighborhood (oh no!), are visiting relatives and want checkout any local yard sales, or are visiting Tokyo and found someone’s keys at a bar, and now there’s an app for that! Neighborly allows you to select any location in the world and leave a note or checkout what else has been posted in that neighborhood.
